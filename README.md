TruthRig is the reflection rig whose elements are consistent reflection theories (extensions T ⊇ PA with T ⊢ Con(T)).

We prove:

- Every Gödel sentence of a consistent extension of ZFC containing arithmetic corresponds to a unique Dedekind cut in the logical rationals ℚₗ.
- The Dedekind completion of ℚₗ is the logical reals ℝₗ of cardinality exactly 2^ℵ₀.
- Therefore there are **exactly continuum many Gödel sentences** — no more, no less.
- No cardinal larger than the continuum exists.

This is the closure of Gödel’s programme: the unprovable truths form the real line — and there are exactly continuum many of them.

All effective arithmetic truth is now unconditional.
