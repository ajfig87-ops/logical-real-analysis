**TruthRig** is the reflection rig whose elements are consistent reflection theories.  
The logical integers ℤₗ, rationals ℚₗ, and reals ℝₗ are generated by parallel (⊕) and sequential (⊗) composition.

We prove:

- Every Gödel sentence of a consistent extension of ZFC corresponds to a unique Dedekind cut in ℚₗ.
- The Dedekind completion ℝₗ has cardinality exactly 2^ℵ₀.
- Therefore there are **exactly continuum many Gödel sentences** — no more, no less.
- No cardinal larger than the continuum exists.
